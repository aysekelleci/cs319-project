# Description

Our project will be a web-based application for Erasmus. Bilkent Students who will attend the Erasmus/Exchange program can submit their documents and information. Also, they can communicate with Erasmus coordinators via this app. Our aim is to enhance the process of applying to the Erasmus/Exchange programs with the least amount of physical paperwork and e-mails. With this app the responsibility of instructors will be decreased.

# Features of the application

There are two target audiences: Students and coordinators. Based on the type of the user, features will vary. 
  
Students are able to apply to only one program, and they must meet some conditions for the placement, such as CGPA and registration semester thresholds. Given that they meet the conditions, students will be placed in universities automatically based on their scores and universities' quota. At all times, they will be able to see the status of their application, such as nomination to the universities, inspection or approval by the coordinators etc. After their nomination, students will be able to choose the courses they want to study during the exchange. A list of pre-approved and rejected courses and a convenient way to ask the coordinators' approval for new courses will be provided. After the mobility, they will see which courses were accepted to be transferred by the coordinator and the Faculty Administration Board. Throughout the whole process, various files will need to be uploaded and therefore file uploading/downloading features will be implemented in our app. 
  
  Administrative part has much more straightforward features. Coordinators will be able to see students' information, application process, and when needed, they will accept or reject applications and course choices, with optional messages. If a student amends a form, they will be able to see a highlighted version with changes. They can quickly search for and access all files a student has submitted. After the mobility, they will create a course transfer form. All board decisions will be logged. 
 
### Other ideas (to be discussed & formatted)
- Board members as a 3rd type of user? 
- Automatic pre-approval form/learning agreement/course transfer form generation
- Keyword detection in messaging
- Information about the programs will be gathered in one place for easy access
- The course transfer document needs to be physically signed by the Dean, this process might be done digitally with encryption to ensure authenticity
