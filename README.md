# Description

Our project will be a web-based application for Erasmus. Bilkent Students who will attend the Erasmus/Exchange program can submit their documents and information. Also, they can communicate with Erasmus coordinators via this app. Our aim is to enhance the process of applying Erasmus/Exchange. With this app the responsibility of intstructors will be decreased.

# Features of the application

  There are two target audiences, one is students and the other is coordinators. Based on the type of the user, features will vary. 
  Sudents, if they meet the conditions of applying, will be able to apply for universities. After the acceptance, they will be choosing courses that they want to study during Erasmus. Throughout the whole process, many file uploads will occur so, our system will also provide file uploading/receiving features.
  Administrative part has much more straightforward features that coordinators will be able to see students' information, application process and when needed, they will accept or reject applications and course choices.
